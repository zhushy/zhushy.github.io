* [Asymptotically optimal one- and two-sample testing with kernels](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3059267), IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2021
    
    This work (almost) solves an open problem in information theory and statistics, *the universal hypothesis testing problem*, dating back to 
    a work of W. Hoeffding in 1965. The same universal optimality is further established  in two-sample settings where an extended 
     version of Sanov's theorem is proved.

* [Causal discovery with reinforcement learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1g2skStPB), International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2020
     
     We apply reinforcement learning to causal discovery and achieve promissing results on both synthetic and real datasets. This work receives highest review scores 
    (34 out of 2594 submissions) and is selected as an oral presentation (48 out of 2594 submissions) at ICLR'2020.
